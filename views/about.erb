<h1>About</h1>
<br/>
<p>
  My name is John Schoeman.  I am a software developer knowledgeable in web development. I delight in finding elegant solutions to challenging problems and thrive in highly collaborative environments. My constantly expanding skillset includes Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, React Native, GraphQL, HTML/CSS, RDBMS and related technologies.

  When I'm not coding I enjoy boardgames, lindy hop, and cooking saag paneer (with homemade paneer!).
